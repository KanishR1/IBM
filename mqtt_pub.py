client_id is the unique client id string used when connecting to the broker. 
If client_id is zero length or None, then the behaviour is defined by which protocol version is in use. 
If using MQTT v3.1.1, then a zero length client id will be sent to the broker and the broker will generate a random for the client. 
If using MQTT v3.1 then an id will be randomly generated. 
In both cases, clean_session must be True. If this is not the case a ValueError will be raised.
